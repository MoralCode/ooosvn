# OpenOffice Version Control

This is an OpenOffice extension providing source control for OpenOffice.org documents.

The [original extension](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/ooosvn) was last updated in 2013 and may not be compatible with openoffice 4. This repository is a fork of [original subversion source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ooosvn/) that has been converted to a git repo using [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git).


## Project Goals
The goal of this fork is to:
- [ ] update the original extension to be compatible with newer versions of OpenOffice/LibreOffice
- [ ] Add support for git repositories
- [ ] (possibly) make the UI easier to use so that it is able to be used by people who dont have experience with using git
