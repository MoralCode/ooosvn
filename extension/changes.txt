0.3.6 :: 2007-07-24

### New Features ###
1654579 - Added a check for SVN during first run wizard.  It currently requires
1.3 (the
oldest supported by Tigris) to pass though if anyone has any problem with this
limit and a better suggestion for what the requirment should be, please get in
touch.

Added a configuration complete dialogue to the end of the installation wizard.

### Bug fixes ###
1758195 - Fixed failing to generate thumbnail images.  This was due to a broken
shell
command that didn't get spotted earlier as not many people use it anyway. 
Thanks to monnier for spotting this error.

0.3.5 :: 2007-04-10

### New Features ###
Added document existence check to file loading on recoverSVN and GetUserguide

Added working dir and scripts installation tool.  This will create the home
repository also.  It is recommended that users upgrading run Tools > Addons >
Install OOoSVN scripts to check their scripts are up to date.

No more two layered installation.  The outer ZIP file is the extension so just
install the ZIP file in OOo through the extension manager and go.

FirstRunCheck Function which checks for existence of workingdir, if not found it
creates the working directory, home repository and installs the scripts there. 
This should make installation straight forward.

### Bug Fixes ###
1690311 - Fixed broken ImportSVN module.  This was down to some problems with
the Filename Function, this won't happen again.  Thanks to earlycj5 for
reporting this.

0.3.4 :: 2007-03-30

### New Features ###
1655501 - Started adding icons to SVN menu.  More, including large size and high
contrast, will happen over time.

1656450 - Added Userguide download tool: Help > Get latest OOoSVN Userguide. 
This checks out the latest version of the document from Sourceforge and builds
it for the user.

Working directory creation function

A whole load of experimental stuff that's not hooked up properly yet but may be
useful for anyone interested in where this project is going.

### Bug Fixes ###
Changed #! /bin/bash top #!/bin/bash which is more correct, even though both
work.  Thanks to Richard Bos for his suggestion.

0.3.3 :: 2007-03-06

### New Features ###
CreateSVN command added.  Not currently set up by default as it's better from a
testing POV to do this on the command line.  Fully utilising this function is
dependent upon implementing multi-repository handling.  Thanks to Yuval Aviel
for his work on this.

Some more modularisation work done.  Thanks to Yuval Aviel for his input.

### Bug Fixes ###
Changed a number of shell script executions so that OOo waits for the script to
finish before executing.  This fixes many problems and makes the info and log
display bugs (1654245, 1654246) fixed properly this time.  It also means that
the documented is rebuilt and reloaded on import so the Repo-UUID field is held
(1658949).  Thanks to Yuval Aviel for his help on this.

Fixed a minor bug in the syntax of a few cut commands.  Not harmful, just not
correct.  Thanks to Richard Bos for his suggestion.

1654590 - Document reloads now happen immediately.  Much quicker and safer. 
This is related to the big load of bug fixes too.


0.3.2 :: 2007-02-13

### New features ###
Switched back to using .zip extension from .oxt.  The packages are exactly the
same but .zip will install on OOo <2.1 without problems.

1654374 - Metadata can now be written to meta.xml on import.  Currently all it
does is replace the Info 1 field with the Repository-UUID field.  This is a
requirement for multiple repositories as it allows a repository to be uniquely
referenced.

1655618 - Repository referred to by UUID, see above.

1654600 - Online help added to Help menu.  Will in the long run be replaced as
OOo's extension framework will in future allow 3rd party help content.

### Bug Fixes ###
1654245 - Further improvement of the Info display code. Almost bomb proof now
and really should never display the wrong info version or blank.

1654246 - Log should now be correct all the time now, same as above.

0.3.1 :: 2007-02-07
===================

### New features ###
1655501 - Comments no longer hardcoded as 'Revision' in commit.sh.  Now the
comment is taken as $5 and is different for different operations. 
'Incremental-save' and 'Manual-commit' are currently being used for OnSavedSVN
and CommitSVN.

Some more work on OnPrintSVN.  It will save and commit a file with 'Printed'
comment although as save will commit anyway, this does nothing useful yet.

### Bug Fixes ###
1654245 - Info screen should now always be up to date and correct.

1654251 - Some more references to repo changed to ConvertToURL(WorkingDir) in
OOo Basic.  These are requirements for separating repository from working
directory.

1655454 - Commit no longer writes ~/commit.txt.  This was some obsolete
debugging thing that was no use anyway.

Partial fix for log not being up to date.  Should very rarely be incorrect now.
